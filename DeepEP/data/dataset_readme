This directory includes datasets used in Bioinofrmatics “DeepEP: Identification of Essential Proteins based on deep learning method using PPI network and gene expression data” paper.

As described in the paper two source datasets are used. 
PPI network and gene expression data 

It is currently in numpy format. 

protein_emb.npy is the 64-dimensional vector which is generated by node2vec by using PPI network. Its shape is 5297 proteins x 64 features.
protein_matrix.npy is the gene expression data and we reshape it to 5297 proteins x 3 cycles x 12 time points.
protein_matrix.npy is the labels of proteins (1:essential proteins and 0: non-essential proteins).

You can split the raw dataset by yourself. In our demo, we use the 80% as training dataset and 20% as testing dataset. The detail of dataset division can see the paper and the code.
